Key points igw_name: internet gate way which can talk to internet {conneted public subnet}
security_group_name : acts as firewall for our EC2 instance {restricts the in and out traffic}

VPC.tf reffer to
# Resource to associate the Route Table with the public subnet
resource "aws_route_table_association" "rt-association" {
  # Associate the route table with the public subnet
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.rt.id
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public-subnet.id
For accessing the public subnet through internet we need to create internet gate way and route table, mapping the routes to cidr blks and iternet gateway and route table association to connect to internet gate way.
